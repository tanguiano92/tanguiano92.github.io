 <center><p>I created this piece using in-line code and by basically playing around with RBG<br>
   codes. I aspired to make something in relation to the basic RBG, CYMK and black and white<br>
   colors in relation to the color systems used in web design and so on. I also was experimenting<br>
   with the sizing and trying to make each ellipse look as though they are in different stages of<br>
   creation (i.e. beginner, intermediate and advanced). Although this code painting is quite simple,<br>
   it was a long process to get the image to the point that it is at now. I plan to keep working on<br>
   this piece and adding more to it and play around with the concept a bit further.</p></center>
