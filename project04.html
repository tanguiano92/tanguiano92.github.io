 <center><p>I created this piece using in-line code and by basically playing around<br>
   with RBG codes. I aspired to make something in relation to the basic RBG, CYMK and<br> 
   black and white colors in relation to the color systems used in web design and so<br> 
   on. I also was experimenting with the sizing and trying to make each ellipse look<br> 
   as though they are in different stages of creation (i.e. beginner, intermediate and<br>
   advanced). Although this code painting is quite simple, it was a surprisingly long<br> 
   process to get the image to the point that it is at now. I plan to keep working on<br>
   this piece and adding more to it and play around with the concept a bit further.</p></center>

  <center><p>Ghostie's eyes will follow the mouse around the screen; he waves when his arm is clicked<br>
             on. Click on the purple orb and a magenta one appears. Click on the background behind<br> 
             the left of his head and the orb disappears again. The bones are Ghostie's and he loves<br>
             to make them fly for his guests as a party trick. This is my avatar and a beginning concept<br>
             for a short comic idea. With the Halloween season fast approaching, I figured it would be<br>
             appropriate to create an avatar in relation to the holiday.</p></center>
