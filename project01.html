<p> My digital collage looks like an odd, colorful explosion of geometric shapes meets<br>
 unamused classic monsters. Speaking for myself, being the creator of this collage,<br>
 it feels inviting and and interesting to stare at. The various bright colors along<br>
 with the curious shapes hides the dark undertones of the image containing tortured<br>
 monsters and a young girl weidling a knife. Perhaps similar to a venus fly trap;<br>
 setting off an intriguing allure and not sending out any indication of something<br>
 sinister. The personal motivation for this piece was my love for classic movies and<br>
comics in the horror genre. The monsters included in the collage are Frankenstein's<br>
monster, Count Dracula, the Wolfman, and the Mummy. Underneath them is an intimdating<br>
young goth girl. The intention for this project was simply to pay homage to classic<br>
media, such as film and comics from the 1930's and on. Often times people forget where<br>
today's media was born from and it I wanted to prove that it has not been forgotten,<br>
or pushed aside as though it is no longer of importance to media today. I would like<br>
for my audience to percieve this piece however they like; whether it be on a computer<br>
as a gif jpeg file, as a flat poster on a wall, or as an augmented reality overlay.<br>
I believe the point of the work would get across in any of the above, however they<br>
choose to view the piece. My biggest influences for creating this project are the<br>
classic monster I so dearly love and the music album "Famous Monsters" by the Misfits. </p></center> <br>
