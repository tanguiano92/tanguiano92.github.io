  <center><p>Skull still life was a study piece. I was practicing and playing<br>
             with the concept of bringing lights out of shadow, rather than<br>
             adding shadow to light. This piece was my first attempt as realism.</p></center>

  <br>
  <br>
  <center><p>Clown Coming Undone is a piece about mental instability. The<br>
             inspiration for this sculpture came from the clown epidemic that was<br>
             going on around the Bay Area when the new "IT" film was coming out.<br>
             The transition of something that is supposed to be innocent and bring<br>
             joy and laughter ultimately becoming something horrific and terrifying<br>
             interests me greatly. Therefore I created what appears to be a clown who<br>
             is mentally unraveling. The balloons atop his head represent innocence,<br>
             joy, and love leaving the clowns body as something more sinister is taking<br>
             over. The clown has a blank stare and holds a wide smile while he is falling<br>
             apart, as many devastated people tend to do. He lost his purpose due to stigma.</p></center>

  <br>
  <br>
  <center><p>This was my first real attempt at realism with graphite and charcoal<br>
             on white sketch paper. I taught myself how to create the illusion of<br>
             depth and 3D forms after many years of drawing cartoons and attempting<br>
             realism once every blue moon. This piece took about 24 hours to complete.<br>
             I made this piece because I got inspired by Chloe Moretz's portrayal of<br>
    Carrie in the 2013 recreation of the classic horror film.</p></center>

  <center><p>This was another face study I had done as I was getting more<br>
    comfortable with shading and adding deep shadows to human features. I<br>
    referenced an image of Emma Stone for this work.</p></center>

  <center><p>This is an image of Sharon Tate I drew after visiting her grave in Los<br>
             Angeles. She had always been one of my favorite actresses and after I<br>
             visited her, I had the strong urge to immortalize her in a work of mine.<br>
             I consider this piece another face study, however I also used it as a way<br>
             to soend time with her. I felt very connected her while creating this piece<br>
             and I believe that is how any art piece should be created. Through a deep<br>
             connection to the subject.</p></center>

  <center><p>This is one photo from a series of different cemetery shots I had taken<br>
             for no other reason than to show how beautiful and peaceful cemeteries can<br>
             be. Unfortunately many people fear cemeteries or view them as bad places<br>
             because deceased people are buried in them but I believe the opposite. I believe<br>
             cemeteries are beautiful. The layouts, the architecture, the elaborate head-<br>
             stones, and the things people leave on their loved-one's graves to honor their<br>
             memory; They are beautiful in their way. One would be surprised at some of the<br>
             amazing sculptures and artworks newer cemeteries have. Not to mention the people<br>
             who lay in rest in them; I believe they deserve to be remembered. I may not know<br>
             what any of those people looked like or who they were, but I know their names.<br>
             In homage to the people who were here before us, I create these pieces.</p></center>
