  <center><h1>Artist Statement</h1></center>
    <center><p>My practice is a mix of mediums. At a young age I grew to love art so intensely that I could not pick 
             only one medium to work in. Therefore in my portfolio holds only one iota of the diverse pieces I have 
             created throughout my lifetime. Through leisure, coursework and based on how I was feeling on a certain
             day, week, month, or year; the subjects of most of my work includes obscure, often dark, subjects that 
             have happened in history and film not all of my subjects are from the morbidities of this world's past 
             and media. I am increasingly inspired by true crime, old Universal films, scary stories and the outcasts
             of society. Artists such as Joel Peter Witkin, Sylvia Plath, Marina Abromovic, and Tim Burton, to name a
             few, often come to mind when I am planning an artwork. Music plays its role as well with artists such as The
             Misfits, Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, and many others. When I feel the need to create something,
             I often get into my car, turn on my radio and drive alone, this is how moft, if not all, my ideas manifest.</p></center>
  <center><p>I am deeply interested in subjects, topics, and unpopular opinions that are misunderstood or feared. Therefore,
             my art will include scenes of monsters, murder victims, and often cemeteries. I enjoy sprinkling cincepts of
             death in my work not as a way to make others uncomfortable, but in a way that takes the stigma away from it. 
             I find it ironic how many people seem to believe that if they do not talk about death, that it won't happen to 
             them. It is the one thing we all have in common. Our end. I feel that this mindset of "I am going to live forever"
             pushes many of us to take for granted what we have, so I enjoy giving a reminder of live life to the fullest
             because one day it will be gone. Overall, I capture images of cemeteries in peaceful setting; I make monsters
             in neon colors; and I draw murder victims and leave out the context, so for that single moment, everyone forgets
             the horrendous event and remembers the innocent person. I wish to work on documentaries as well, therefore I 
             have created videos in a documentary style to get a feel for a camera on my hands and in my mind.</p></center>
  
  <center><p>I have utilized a plethora of different methods to create my work. From traditional studio art tools/techniques,
             to cartooning, and in digital softwares. Currently I have been working in the Atom web editor, coding images 
             and small animations, working in Qlone creating digital, 3D sculptures, and dabbling in some projection mapping and
             video editing. Lastly, I create scenes of curiosity and whimsicalness in relation to my life experiences and personal
             interests. I build my virtual sculptures and digital collage pieces using a mix of software, such as Maya, Meshmixer,
             Photoshop, Lighroom and Atom. The point of my work is to provoke thoughts about who we, as humans, are. As well as to
             pose the questions: What is our purpose? Are we truly living? Should fear hold us back? In the hopes that this will 
             help someone break out of whatever keeps the locked inside social norms or personal fears. I want my audience to 
             feel free and dare to make a change, or be different, if even for a moment.</p></center>
    
  <center><p>I am currently on a accelerated path at San Jose State University to make sure I graduate on-time. I have been taking
             five classes each semester. I am currently in ART 75: Intro to Digital Video and have two of the projects from coursework
             added in this portfolio under the HypermediaART link. I will be adding more artworks throughout my college journey here
             in this portfolio. Stay tuned! Thank you.</p></center>
