  <center><h1>Artist Statement</h1></center>
  <center><p>My practice is a mix of mediums. At a young age I grew to love art so intensely that I could not pick only one medium<br>
             to work in. Therefore in my portfolio holds only one iota of the diverse pieces I have created throughout my lifetime.<br> 
             Through leisure, coursework and based on how I was feeling on a certain day, week, month, or year; the subjects of most<br>
             of my work includes obscure, often dark, subjects that have happened in history and film not all of my subjects are from<br> 
             the morbidities of this world's past and media. I am increasingly inspired by true crime, old Universal films, scary<br>
             stories and the outcasts of society. Artists such as Joel Peter Witkin, Sylvia Plath, Marina Abromovic, and Tim Burton,<br>
             to name a few, often come to mind when I am planning an artwork. Music plays its role as well with artists such as The<br>
             Misfits, Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, and many others. When I feel the need to create something, I often get<br>
             into my car, turn on my radio and drive alone, this is how moft, if not all, my ideas come to me.</p></center>
  <center><p>I am deeply interested in subjects, topics, and unpopular opinions that are misunderstood or feared. Therefore, my art<br>
             will include scenes of monsters, murder victims, and often cemeteries. I enjoy sprinkling cincepts of death in my work<br>
             not as a way to make others uncomfortable, but in a way that takes the stigma away from it. I find it ironic how many<br>
             people seem to believe that if they do not talk about death, that it won't happen to them. It is the one thing we all<br>
             have in common. I capture images of cemeteries in peaceful setting; I make monsters in neon colors; and I draw murder<br>
             victims and leave out the context, so for that single moment, everyone forgets the horrendous event and remembers the<br>
             innocent person. I wish to work on documentaries as well, therefore I have created videos in a documentary style to get<br>
             a feel for a camera on my hands and in my mind.</p></center>
