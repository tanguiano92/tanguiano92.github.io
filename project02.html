</p></center> I created this video to conjure a feeling of uneasiness in my audience. I believe unsettling<br>
 images and videos are more influential than those that are not, therefore I created "Lost Soul".<br>
 The story of the video is a wandering soul trying to find its way out of the fog, looking for<br>
 the end of the mist and the forest. Perhaps it is in purgatory, and does not know how long it has<br>
 been lost for. I wanted this short film to be open-ended and force the viewers to be left haunted. by<br>
 The impression of this film is sadness, emptiness and endlessness. These are the feelings I had<br>
 experienced during the ten years I suffered from deep chronic depression. In which I felt like a lost<br>
 soul and was not sure if I would continue on each day up until about a year and a half ago when I over-<br>
 came it. This small film collage loosely represents how I felt walking through life each day, faking a,<br>
 smile and trying to hide what was really going on inside.<br>
