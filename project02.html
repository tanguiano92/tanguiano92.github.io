<center><p>I created this video to conjure a feeling of uneasiness in my audience.<br> 
  I believe unsettlingimages and videos are more influential than those that are not,<br> 
  therefore I created "Lost Soul".The story of the video is a wandering soul trying<br> 
  to find its way out of the fog, looking forthe end of the mist and the forest.<br> 
  Perhaps it is in purgatory, and does not know how long it hasbeen lost for. I<br> 
  wantedthis short film to be open-ended and force the viewers to be left haunted by<br>
  the impression of this film is sadness, emptiness and endlessness. These are the<br> 
  feelings I had experienced during the ten years I suffered from deep chronic depression.<br>
  In which I felt like a lost soul and was not sure if I would continue on each day up<br>
  until about a year and a half ago when I overcame it. This small film collage loosely<br>
  represents how I felt walking through life each day, faking a, smile and trying to hide<br>
  what was really going on inside.</p></center><br>

    <center><p>I created this piece to spread awareness of how the media glorifies tragic events.<br>
               In the clip, you see the places around the Bay Area (i.e. San Francisco, Vallejo,<br>
               Lake Berryessa, Benicia) where the Zodiac Killer committed his heinous crimes in<br>
               the late seventies. In each of the four places are images of the victims as an<br> 
               audio clips that play a news broadcast and a talk show both airing cintent about<br> 
               the zodiac.In the news clip audio, the anchorman quickly glosses over the four<br> 
               victims and continues on about the Zodiac. In the next clip, two men are allowing<br> 
               the Zodiac to talk on their show. At no point in time did they shut down the caller.<br>
               This is a common occurrance to this day where the news and other media will keep<br> 
               the Killer, mass shooter, or other "juicy" tragedies done by the hand of mentally<br> 
               ill people on screen and in the news. The victims are often soon forgotten and the<br>
               murderer becomes immortalized. This video is supposed to function as a wake-up call<br> 
               to how often this ouccrance happens. The media has to stop glorifying murderers<br>
               and remembering victims. The more they put bad people in the news, the more ideas it<br> 
               gives to other mentally unstable people who want to get the same type of attention<br> 
               or be "remembered" for something.</p></center><br>
