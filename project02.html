<center><p>I created this video to conjure a feeling of uneasiness in my audience. I believe unsettling<br>
 images and videos are more influential than those that are not, therefore I created "Lost Soul".<br>
 The story of the video is a wandering soul trying to find its way out of the fog, looking for<br>
 the end of the mist and the forest. Perhaps it is in purgatory, and does not know how long it has<br>
 been lost for. I wanted this short film to be open-ended and force the viewers to be left haunted. by<br>
 The impression of this film is sadness, emptiness and endlessness. These are the feelings I had<br>
 experienced during the ten years I suffered from deep chronic depression. In which I felt like a lost<br>
 soul and was not sure if I would continue on each day up until about a year and a half ago when I over-<br>
 came it. This small film collage loosely represents how I felt walking through life each day, faking a,<br>
  smile and trying to hide what was really going on inside. <br></center>

    <center><p>When I was thnking of ideas for this project, many possibilities ran through my<br>
      mind but none of them felt right to me. I could have made a cultural comment on the usual<br>
      things like social media, politics and what have you, even though I am passionate about those topics,<br>
      I wanted to deviate into something that held meaning to me. I was driving home from class one day<br>
      and drove past Lake Herman Road in Benicia, as I had many times before, but this time was different.<br>
      I began to think about the unsolved Zodiac murders and as I thought about them, I realized I knew so<br>
      much about the Zodiac but I could not remember not even one of the victims names. Not a one. And it<br>
      dawned on me: this is a cultural and media issue, and a big one at that. When tragedies happen, our media<br>
      and news broadcasters often fixate on the criminal and floss over the victims. They give us the names<br>
      of the victims but plaster the villian's face, name, and method of killing all over everything in which<br>
      the public forgets the innocent people who lost their lives and focus on the criminal. There are many serial<br>
      killer fanpages and documentaries out there that discuss serial killers and their psychology in an attempt to<br> 
      understand what made them into monsters. Was it nurture vs. nature? Did they have a sexual deviancy in youth?<br> 
      The media will exploit these characters as though they are celebrities and it often causes other mentally unstable<br>
      people to idolize these monsters and commit acts of violence of their own. The point of my project is to<br>
      push people to remember the victims and forget the monsters. Showing these awful people in the news and giving them<br>
      television segments and interviews is doing more harm than it is good for our society. We need to stop glorifying<br>
      these heinous acts and the unstable people who committed them and honor the innocent people who were murdered and left<br>
      in the shadow of their killers. As though they belong to that person. When you say Jeffrey Dahmer, Richard Ramirez,<br>
      Charles Manson, or John Wayne Gacy, to name a few, there is no doubt that someone won't know who they are or what<br>
      they have done. But ask those same people what any of the victims names are, there is a good chance you'll get a blank<br>
      stare in response. In most cases communities want to forget the<br>the tragedy and the murderer who caused them,<br> 
      and with that the victims go forgotten along with their killer. Is that fair? No. Therefore I made this piece to<br>
      pull the victoms out of the Zodiac's shadow as well as expose him for the attention-seeker he truly was.<br>
      He was a coward who simply wanted attention, and took the lives of four people to get it.<br></center>
